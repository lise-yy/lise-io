<p>2014 is the first year I spent entirely with <a href="http://csssr.com">CSSSR</a> — an outstanding web-development company. In 365 days I've made it from junior manager to COO, formed the best team in the company, led difficult projects and clients, and trained other managers.</p>

<p>Apart from that I've been traveling and living in different places; Belarus, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Cyprus they were. At the moment I'm in Sri Lanka, tanned and happy.</p>

<p>So at some point — probably a month ago — I realised that all the experience I gained, both working and traveling, had started to overwhelm me, and a blog should have been created to share the knowledge. I don't make any promises, but I hope it'll be entertaining for some and useful for others.</p>
